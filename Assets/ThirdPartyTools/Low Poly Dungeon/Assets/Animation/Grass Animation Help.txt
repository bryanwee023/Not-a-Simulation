Steps for Animated Grass:

- You have to create an empty gameobject (Root) and add a Grass prefab (Prefabs/Vegetation folder) as his
  child. You MUSTN'T move grass prefabs (These prefabs have animations that moves the prefab when you play
  the scene, you only must move the root gameobject).

- Add 2 components to Grass prefab previously selected: 

	- "Randomize Animator Parameter" Script with next parameters:
		- Parameter: Random
		- Min Value: 1
		- Max Value: 4 (There are 4 animations but you can create new animations for more grass
		  movement varation with Unity Animator)
		- Min Time/Max Time (You can choose different values for different results)

	- An Animator with "GrassController" applied in controller slot of this component.

- Desactivate Static Object in grass prefab because animation are not compatible with bake objects (All prefabs 
  are Statics for Global Ilumination baked) 

- You can modify Parameters of Animation transitions into Grass Controller ("GrassController") like 
  "Transition Duration" for better results of grass movement.

- You can add new animations (Previously mentioned) created with the unity animator into the "GrassController" but
  it's important to change "Max Value" of "Randomize Animator Parameter" Script with total numbers of animations
  applied into "GrassController", and REMEMBER to create transitions that connect these new animations with all 
  animations already created with the same values. 

- 1 Simple Scene is also included to show an animated grass example (Grass Test Scene).
